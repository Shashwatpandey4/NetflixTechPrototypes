# ML Annotation Assistant

## Overview

The ML Annotation Assistant is designed to enhance the annotation process by providing real-time object and scene detection capabilities, auto-suggesting annotations, and displaying confidence scores for suggested labels. This project aims to streamline the annotation workflow and improve accuracy through machine learning techniques.

## Models

### Object and Scene Detection

- **Model Selection**: We will use [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) for real-time object detection due to its speed and accuracy. YOLOv5 provides a good balance between performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Training Data**: Utilize the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/) for pre-trained weights. You can also supplement it with custom datasets containing specific scenes/objects relevant to your application.
  
### Suggested Training Approach

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Collect images and videos relevant to the objects/scenes of interest.
   - Annotate the images/videos using tools like [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) or [VGG Image Annotator](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/).
   - Organize the data into a structured format compatible with YOLOv5.

2. **Training Process**:
   - Clone the YOLOv5 repository and follow the instructions to set up the environment.
   - Fine-tune the pre-trained model with the annotated dataset.
   - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mAP (mean Average Precision) on the validation/test set.
   - Optimize the model based on evaluation results.

## Data

- **Images**: Store high-resolution images relevant to the object/scene detection tasks in the `data/images/` folder.
- **Videos**: Store sample videos for testing the annotation assistant in the `data/videos/` folder.
- **Annotations**: Store annotation files in a structured format (e.g., YOLO format, COCO format) in the `data/annotations/` folder.

## Tasks

### Development Tasks

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Collect and preprocess sample data (images/videos).
   - Label the data for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Model Training**
   - Clone and set up the YOLOv5 repository.
   - Prepare datasets and fine-tune the model.

3. **Real-time Detection and Suggestion System**
   - Implement a detection pipeline in `detection.py` to process video frames or images.
   - Implement the suggestion mechanism in `suggest.py` to recommend annotations.

4. **Confidence Score Calculation**
   - Integrate confidence score calculations in `score.py` and display the scores alongside suggested annotations.

5. **User Interaction and Feedback Loop**
   - Develop a feedback mechanism for users to accept or modify suggestions.
   - Consider implementing a feedback loop for retraining the model based on user interactions.

6. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Write unit tests in the `tests/` folder for all main functionalities.
   - Optimize the code for performance and ensure scalability.

### API 

    setup api end points for front-end to use this ML service

### Deployment Tasks

1. **Integration with Frontend**
   - Collaborate with frontend developers to integrate the annotation assistant into the main application.
   - Ensure real-time detection works seamlessly with the user interface.

2. **Load Testing**
   - Conduct load testing to ensure the annotation assistant scales effectively under high demand.

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Set up monitoring tools to track the performance of the annotation assistant post-deployment.
